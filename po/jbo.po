# bg_misc.c descriptions
msgid "The most basic alien structure. It allows aliens to spawn and protect the Overmind. Without any of these, the Overmind is left nearly defenseless and defeat is imminent."
msgstr ""

msgid "A collective consciousness that controls all the alien structures in its vicinity. It must be protected at all costs, since its death will render alien structures defenseless."
msgstr ""

msgid "Used to obstruct corridors and doorways, hindering humans from threatening the spawns and Overmind. Barricades will shrink to allow aliens to pass over them, however."
msgstr ""

msgid "Ejects lethal poisonous acid at an approaching human. These are highly effective when used in conjunction with a trapper to hold the victim in place."
msgstr ""

msgid "Fires a blob of adhesive spit at any non-alien in its line of sight. This hinders their movement, making them an easy target for other defensive structures or aliens."
msgstr ""

msgid "Laces the attacks of any alien that touches it with a poison that will gradually deal damage to any humans exposed to it. The booster also increases the rate of health regeneration for any nearby aliens."
msgstr ""

msgid "Houses millions of tiny insectoid aliens. When a human approaches this structure, the insectoids attack."
msgstr ""

msgid "The most basic human structure. It provides a means for humans to enter the battle arena. Without any of these the humans cannot spawn and defeat is imminent."
msgstr ""

msgid "Automated base defense that is effective against large targets but slow to begin firing. Should always be backed up by physical support."
msgstr ""

msgid "A structure equipped with a strong electrical attack that fires instantly and always hits its target. It is effective against smaller aliens and for consolidating basic defense."
msgstr ""

msgid "An essential part of the human base, providing a means to upgrade the basic human equipment. A range of upgrades and weapons are available for sale from the armoury."
msgstr ""

msgid "A structure that enables self-repair functionality in human structures. Each Defence Computer built increases repair rate slightly."
msgstr ""

msgid "A structure that automatically restores the health and stamina of any human that stands on it. It may only be used by one person at a time. This structure also issues medkits."
msgstr ""

msgid "All structures except the telenode rely on a reactor to operate. The reactor provides power for all the human structures either directly or via repeaters. Only one reactor can be built at a time."
msgstr ""

msgid "A power distributor that transmits power from the reactor to remote locations, so that bases may be built far from the reactor."
msgstr ""

msgid "Similar to the base Granger, except that in addition to being able to build structures it has a spit attack that slows victims and the ability to crawl on walls."
msgstr ""

msgid "Has a lethal reflexive bite and the ability to crawl on walls and ceilings."
msgstr ""

msgid "A support class able to crawl on walls and ceilings. Its melee attack is most effective when combined with the ability to grab and hold its victims in place. Provides a weak healing aura that accelerates the healing rate of nearby aliens."
msgstr ""

msgid "In addition to the basic Basilisk abilities, the Advanced Basilisk sprays a poisonous gas which disorients any nearby humans. Has a strong healing aura that that accelerates the healing rate of nearby aliens."
msgstr ""

msgid "Has a melee attack and the ability to jump off walls. This allows the Marauder to gather great speed in enclosed areas."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Advanced Marauder has all the abilities of the basic Marauder with the addition of an area effect electric shock attack."
msgstr ""

msgid "Possesses a melee attack and the pounce ability, which may be used as both an attack and a means to reach remote locations inaccessible from the ground."
msgstr ""

msgid "In addition to the basic Dragoon abilities, the Advanced Dragoon has 3 barbs which may be used to attack humans from a distance."
msgstr ""

msgid "A large alien with a strong melee attack, this class can also charge at enemy humans and structures, inflicting great damage. Any humans or their structures caught under a falling Tyrant will be crushed by its weight."
msgstr ""

msgid "Basic weapon. Cased projectile weapon, with a slow clip based reload system."
msgstr ""

msgid "Similar to a chainsaw, but instead of a chain it has an electric arc capable of dealing a great deal of damage at close range."
msgstr ""

msgid "Close range weapon that is useful against larger foes. It has a slow repeat rate, but can be devastatingly effective."
msgstr ""

msgid "Slightly more powerful than the basic rifle, rapidly fires small packets of energy."
msgstr ""

msgid "A portable particle accelerator which causes minor nuclear reactions at the point of impact. It has a very large payload, but fires slowly."
msgstr ""

msgid "Belt drive, cased projectile weapon. It has a high repeat rate but a wide firing angle and is therefore relatively inaccurate."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sprays fire at its target. It is powered by compressed gas. The relatively low rate of fire means this weapon is most effective against static targets."
msgstr ""

msgid "An energy weapon that fires rapid pulses of concentrated energy."
msgstr ""

msgid "Blaster technology scaled up to deliver devastating power. Primary fire must be charged before firing. It has a quick secondary attack that does not require charging."
msgstr ""

msgid "Used for building structures. This includes spawns, power and basic defense. More structures become available with new stages."
msgstr ""

msgid "Protective armour that helps to defend against light alien melee attacks."
msgstr ""

msgid "In addition to protecting your head, the helmet provides a scanner indicating the presence of any friendly or hostile lifeforms and structures in your immediate vicinity."
msgstr ""

msgid "Back-mounted battery pack that permits storage of one and a half times the normal energy capacity for energy weapons."
msgstr ""

msgid "Back-mounted jet pack that enables the user to fly to remote locations. It is very useful against alien spawns in hard to reach spots."
msgstr ""

msgid "A full body armour that is highly effective at repelling alien attacks. It allows the user to enter hostile situations with a greater degree of confidence."
msgstr ""

msgid "A small incendinary device ideal for damaging tightly packed alien structures. Has a five second timer."
msgstr ""

msgid "Ammunition for the currently held weapon."
